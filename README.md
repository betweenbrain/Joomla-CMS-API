In the context of a website or web application, an application-programming interface or API allows software developers to interact with and build upon the data and/or services delivered by your website. Thus, APIs provide limitless flexibility, reach and innovative potential for any website, service or application.

During the last few months, Pierre-Andr√© has performed extensive research and development to discover effective ways of adding an API to a Joomla website. In this interactive session, he will share his findings.

Attendees can expect to learn, why you need an API for your web site, the pros and cons of various API solutions, and why a RESTful API is a good fit for Joomla. Best practices for implementing a well-documented, pragmatic, and RESTful API will be discussed, along with useful tools and sample code for using the com_api component as well as Slim Framework.
